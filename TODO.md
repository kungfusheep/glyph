## Priority Toolkit Features

1. [x] Inline mode - same components work inline (progress bars, menus, spinners)
2. [x] Jump labels - vim-easymotion style quick selection
3. [ ] Pre-composed components - "just works" components (StatusPanel, Gauge, etc.)
4. [ ] Help from metadata - auto-generate help screens from handler metadata
6. [ ] Workbench shell - VSCode-style layout pattern (sidebar, panels, etc.)

we need a nice solution to the pointer/value binding issue

## Other TODOs

- [ ] Optimise flex code to only run when we have flex children
- [ ] Locale-aware number formatting for AutoTable (e.g. `1.234,56` for European locales). Currently hardcoded to English comma separators.
- [ ] Serialisable views: serialise template tree for dev tooling — live inspector, visual debugger, hot style tweaking, record/replay for test snapshots. Connect to a running app over a socket, inspect the Op tree, tweak and push back.



## random ideas


Emergent over prescribed aesthetics.
Expose state and inner workings.
Dense, not sparse.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Engineered for human vision and perception.
Regiment functionalism.
Performance is design.
Verbosity over opacity.
Ignore design trends. Timeless and unfashionable.
Flat, not hierarchical.
Diametrically opposite of minimalism, as complex as it needs to be.
Driven by objective reasoning and common sense.
Don't infantilize users.

Design philosophy: 
- Design for the user, not the designer.
